# LinkPNG E-commerce Platform - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the LinkPNG e-commerce platform. The primary goal is to create a high-fidelity simulation for investor demonstrations, focusing on a simple, visually-driven user experience tailored for the Papua New Guinean market.

## 2. Core Problem

Traditional e-commerce platforms are often too complex for markets with varying literacy levels and limited access to traditional banking. LinkPNG aims to solve this by providing a radically simple, mobile-first platform with flexible payment options.

## 3. Key Features (MVP Simulation)

### 3.1. Frontend User Experience
- **Radical Simplicity:** A visual-first interface with large, clear icons and minimal text.
- **Voice Search:** A prominent voice search feature to overcome literacy barriers.
- **Product Browsing:** Simple grid-based display of products with clear images.
- **Product Details:** A clean product page with essential information and a clear "Add to Cart" button.
- **Shopping Cart:** A straightforward cart and checkout process.
- **Order Tracking:** A detailed, visualized delivery tracking page showing the hub-and-spoke journey of a package.

### 3.2. Backend Simulation
- **Placeholder Data:** The backend will serve static, placeholder data for products, users, and orders.
- **Simulated Logistics:** The system will simulate a logistics partnership, providing realistic tracking updates for the frontend.

    - Mobile Money / Card Payments (simulated)
    - Cash-In Network (simulated)
    - Cash-on-Delivery (simulated)

### 3.4. Gamification
